7. Delay Timer: The utility should support a delay timer function, allowing users to set up a screen grab after a specified delay.
8. Save Options: The utility should allow users to specify the default save location for screen grabs. It should also support automatic saving with predefined naming conventions.
9. Multi-monitor Support: The utility should be able to recognize and handle multiple monitors independently, allowing users to grab screens from any of the connected displays.
